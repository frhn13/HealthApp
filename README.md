# Java Swing Health App

I developed a health app where the user can create an account, log into that account and can then enter and view their BMIs and amount of exercises done over time. In addition, they can compare these values 
over time and get feedback on if they have become more or less healthy. All of this information is stored in separate CSV files which are read from and written to as needed.
